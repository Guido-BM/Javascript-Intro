# Compiled vs. Interpreted Languages

In the world of programming languages, we classify them into two main categories: "compiled" and "interpreted." These categories define how a programming language processes and executes code.

## Compiled Languages

- Compiled languages require a separate compilation step before execution.
- During compilation, the source code is translated into machine code or bytecode.
- Compilation results in an executable file, which can be run independently.
- Examples of compiled languages include C, C++, and Rust.

## Interpreted Languages

- Interpreted languages execute code line by line at runtime.
- The source code is directly processed by an interpreter.
- They are often platform-independent as the interpreter handles translation.
- Popular interpreted languages include Python, Ruby, and JavaScript.

### Understanding the distinction between compiled and interpreted languages helps developers choose the right tool for the job.
